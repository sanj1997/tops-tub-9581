# My Glamm-Clone

This is a collaborative project built by a team of 3 members. MyGlamm is an online store that sells a wide range of lifestyle products, especially for women. I was responsible for implementing the main landing page, login & signup, and user page. A user can edit his email ID and password after logging in. Also, the user can access his past and current ongoing orders.
